    "# The Validity of the SoVi Index\n",
    "### Seth E.  Spielman, David Folch, Joseph Tuccillo\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a script to calculate the Social Vulnerability (Sovi) Index at multiple geographic scales and usign different sets of input variables.  The Sovi index assess a places social vulnerability to natural hazards and has been used in hundreds of publications, in both the academic and policy domains.  We show that this index fails to meet certain intuitive assumptions about the nature of measurement of social vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to illustrate instability in the index and problems with *convergent validity*.  Convergent Validity is the idea that multiple measurements of the same thing, using a valid instruments, should yield similar *absolute* and *relative* measurements.  For example two thermometers measuing the same cup of water should yield the same approximate temperature- this would be an example of validitiy of absolute measurement.  An less rigorous concept of validity is to consider three cups ordered from hottest (_**A**_) to coldest (_**C**_), the two thermometers would be valid in a *relative* sense if their measurements of cups A, B, C differed absolutely (they measured different temperatures for each cup) but still placed cup _**A**_ as the warmest and cup _**C**_ as the coldest.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show in this analysis that the Sovi Index fails this \"cup test\" that is it often mixes up the orders of the cup.  Counties in the United States that are high vulnerability at one scale of measurement (or form the index) are often low vulnerability in a slightly different version of the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables and Components\n",
    "The Sovi Index is constructed using a tecnhnique called Principal Components Analysis, this is matrix decomposition method that uses the covariance matrix of the input data.  Usually, in the social sciences one treats the \"compents\" what come of out a PCA as latent variables.  For example, in Sovi it comon to fine components that measure things like \"race and class\".  In this analysis we also show that this latent variable approach has maked some underlying problems with the Soci index, namely that variables contribute to the index in ways that are profoundly counter intuitive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## There is a paper\n",
    "For an in-depth discussion of these ideas please see the companion paper to this anlysis [URL]() or contact the suthors. "

    "#### Flipping Signs\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that each variable contributes as expected to the final Sovi Index following Eric Tate (2012?) we flip the signs of the input data.  Variables where a high value are expected to contribute negatively to Social vulnerability have their signs flipped, such that positive values become negative.  This has the effect of reversing the sign of the scores used to compute the index.  Consider the variable measuring the percent of households making over \\$200,000 per year, if the mean at the county-level in a state was 5\\% a county two SD above the mean, say one where 10\\% of the population made mroe than $200K, that would have a positive z-score (+2).  However, this high prevalance of wealthy people should reduce the vulnerability, by flipping the signs we ensure that that mean is now -5\\% and a value of -10\\% is two standard deviations *below* the mean.  Thus when multiplied by its (positive) loading a county whit high wealth will have a lower social vulnerability index."
